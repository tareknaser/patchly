# Patchly

Patchly is an AI-powered VS Code extension that identifies and explains ReDoS vulnerabilities in JavaScript and TypeScript without interrupting the developer’s workflow. It applies human-centered design to make learning about security simple and engaging.

Patchly reveals information gradually based on your interest:

1. Passive Awareness: Subtle yellow underlines show vulnerable patterns
2. Quick Summary: Hover to see a brief explanation
3. Technical Details: View detailed diagnostics in the Problems panel
4. Choose The Next Step (lightbulb menu):

   1. Automatic Fix: Apply a suggested fix directly in your code
   2. Interactive Learning: A guided learning chat to learn more about the vulnerability
   3. Ignore: Dismiss the warning

The idea is to give developers full control. They decide how much info they want, no auto fixes or pop-ups getting in the way, and they can learn at their own speed.
